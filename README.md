# Hexapod-Bot
 3D-Printed Hexapod Robot run on an Arduino and a Raspberry Pi


## TODO (Programming):
Custom timer functionality may be interfering with Arduino functions, so Timer2 interrupts should be changed to run with the Arduino millis() function.

Write drivers for I2C servo board *for fun and practice*

## TODO (Hardware):
Redesign leg-servo interface for better mechanical advantage

Test servos for 6.0v and measure current draw
